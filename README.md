This Python script is a simple yet effective tool for filtering movies based on user preferences. It is designed to work with a DataFrame (presumably loaded with movie data) and allows users to specify their preferred director, a minimum IMDb rating, and their favorite genre. The script then filters the movie list according to these criteria and sorts the results by IMDb rating, displaying the top N recommendations.

Key Features
-User Interaction: Collects user preferences through input prompts.
-Customizable Filtering: Filters movies by director, IMDb rating, and genre.
-Sorting Mechanism: Sorts the filtered movies by their IMDb ratings for better recommendations.
-Top N Recommendations: Displays the top N movies that match the user's preferences.

How to Use
-Ensure your DataFrame (df) is loaded with movie data, including columns for director, IMDb rating, and genre.
-Update the director_column, rating_column, and genre_column variables with the correct column names from your DataFrame.
-Run the script. Input your preferred director, minimum IMDb rating, and genre when prompted.
-View the top N movie recommendations based on your input.

Requirements
Python environment (e.g., Python 3.x)
Pandas library (for DataFrame handling)
Code Structure
User Preference Input: The script starts by asking the user to input their preferences.
Data Filtering: Applies the user's preferences to filter the DataFrame.
Sorting and Recommendations: Sorts the filtered data and prints out the top recommendations.
Additional Notes
This script assumes that the DataFrame (df) is already loaded with the relevant movie data.
You can modify the number of top recommendations (N) as needed.
Case-insensitive matching for genres allows for more flexible user inputs.
